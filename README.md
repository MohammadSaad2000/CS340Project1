# CS340Project1

A simple multithreaded project I made for a class.

This program simulates voters arriving and being helped by workers to cast their ballot. The voters and helpers all have their own threads.
We cannot  use any of the following: wait(), notify(), notifyAll(), the synchronized keyword (for methods or blocks). 
The only synchronization tools/collections we can use are Vectors, volatile variables, AtomicBoolean, and AtomicInteger.
